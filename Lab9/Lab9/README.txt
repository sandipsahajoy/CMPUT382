To test your program:
Step 1: First build your program with the "Submission" configuration selected and make sure the folder "Submission" exists. The path to the executable should be: Submission/*.exe
Step 2: Double click on "Testing_Script.bat"
Step 3: The output to the script should be in a new file called "Marks.js"
Step 4: To view the output double click on "Grade.html" and open it in a browser.
Step 5: If you make changes to your code and re-run the script make sure you reload the "Grade.html" page. If you are unsure you can double check the time stamp at the top.
